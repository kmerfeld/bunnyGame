# bunnyGame
This is a port to python of an old batch game i made

I origanally made the bunny game in sixth or seventh grade.
It is not particuarily good but hey, its the first real program I ever wrote.

I am using this program as a hello world++. just a easy way to learn some of the basics of a new language

The original version is in the folder "original"
