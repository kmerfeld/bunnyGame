# bunnyGame
This is a port to python of an old batch game i made

I origanally made the bunny game in sixth or seventh grade.
It is not particuarily good but hey, its the first real program I ever wrote.
I ported it to python so I could keep it around and run it on anything

The origanal version is in the folder "origanal"
