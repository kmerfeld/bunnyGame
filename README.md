# bunnyGame
This project is a bit of a hello world++

Whenever i want to play with a new language I will probably write a new version of this in that language.


I origanally made the bunny game in sixth or seventh grade.
It is not particuarily good but hey, its the first real program I ever wrote.

The original version is in the folder "original"
